docs: complete Test 7 - single word keyword edge case

Test 7 validates that single-word keywords work well due to content-guided
variant generation. Key findings:

- 20 variants generated from keyword "PS5"
- All variants stayed contextually relevant (sim racing)
- No generic drift despite minimal keyword input
- Quality metrics: 0.44 specificity, 0.75 realism, 0 generic queries
- Coverage: 60% fan-out, 78% overall (78/100 score)
- Processing: 173s (identical to multi-word hybrid mode)

Validates that content understanding effectively constrains variant
generation even with minimal keyword input. Bug fix for quality metrics
confirmed working - all metrics calculated correctly for fan-out variants.
